# Signal_Hypothesis_Testing
This was the final project of a graduate Computational Physics course that I took a few years back. The objective was to identify the mystery signal distribution (and number of signal events), given various background events occuring inside a physics detector. EDA is performed for the training data (in the context of physics, training data are usually obtained by Monte Carlo simulations emulating what we understand about real world physics processes) looking at the distributions, their properties, and correlations between them. Then dimensionality reduction is performed by constructing a Fisher discriminant, and cuts are applied to the mystery data distribution by choosing an appropriate p-value.

Please view the **_project report (MohamedElbeltagi_5002Project.pdf)_** included in the repo for a detailed description of the project. The code is in Python, and uses the C++ ROOT framework at some points.
