# Signal_Hypothesis_Testing
This is a project that was part of a graduate course that I took, to identify the signal distribution, given signal and background. Please view the **_project report (MohamedElbeltagi_5002Project.pdf)_** included in the repo for a detailed description of the project. The code is in Python, and uses the C++ ROOT framework at some points.
