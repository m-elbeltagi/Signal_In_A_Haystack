# Signal_Hypothesis_Testing
This is a project that was part of a graduate course that I took, to identify the signal distribution, given signal and background. The project report (
MohamedElbeltagi_5002Project.pdf) gives a detailed description. The code is in Python, and uses ROOT framework at some points.
